## üìù Some Abstraction

Before I start writing about this project, I personally want to say thank you for this opportunity. 

Me participating in the Clonathon was purely coincidential.  

The challenge wasn't easy, but it was a lot of fun and I learned a bunch of cool things about Elixir, Phoenix, LiveView and creating cool web apps in general.

The key challenge (as always, I assume) was time management. I understand that's the whole point. And the front end, of course...

I know that you love Elixir. I watched many of your videos about it and your inspiring conference performance about how Elixir saved your career. You are one of the reasons I decided to stick with it.

Hope you enjoy trying it out as much as I enjoyed making it.

### Multi-Provider LLM Chat
I took the simplest solution I could think of. I used the OpenRouter API to support multiple providers and recreated their Python API in Elixir (with a little help from AI) in [`openrouter_generator.ex`](lib/t3_clone_elixir/openrouter_generator.ex).

---

### Authentication & Sync
The CLASSIQUE `phx.gen.auth`. Generators rule!

---

### Streaming Responses
This was not easy...

I used the OpenRouter API to stream the tokens, then accumulated them in a GenServer and sent them into LiveView PubSub in [`chat_server.ex`](lib/t3_clone_elixir/chat_server.ex). And that was the easiest part.

Can't say the same for the client side.

This required a little trick. I found a really cool MDeX library that allowed me to render GitHub-style HTML from Markdown on the server‚Äîit even supports syntax highlighting out of the box! Very impressive, but I still had to write a parser to make code blocks with a copy button. You can find the code here: [`chat_messages.ex`](lib/t3_clone_elixir_web/live/chat_live/home_components/chat_messages.ex).

Unfortunately, I failed LaTeX support. I didn't find a server solution and client-side libraries did not work since I already shipped rendered and styled HTML.

---

### Chat CRUD & Branching
`Create`, `delete`, and `rename` chats.

I implemented the schemas to support simple branching but ran out of time to finish the feature.

---

### Resumable Streams and Stream Cancellation
This is the part I'm most proud of.

Since I initially created a GenServer to accumulate the tokens, I just had to add the necessary logic there to support resumable streams.

While the stream continues, the server builds a buffer that is loaded when a user reloads the page. That way, the user not only sees the tokens that were already generated while they were away, but the stream also continues.

A couple of additional states allowed for cancellation of the stream and clearing the buffer.

---

### User Input Drafts

I can't live without drafts. One of the simplest and most useful features that I made. Just save the input in the GenServer and send it to the LiveView when the user reloads the page. Here is the file: [`input_draft_server.ex`](lib/t3_clone_elixir/input_draft_server.ex).

---

### Fast ETS Caching
This is one of the things that I didn't have time to do.

In one of your videos, you described how you cache chats locally in the browser for instant access. I really liked this idea and wanted to instead cache the chats in an ETS table. This approach would give sub-millisecond response time and would feel almost instant.

---
## Some Other Features Worth Mentioning
- Pagination
- Copying messages and code blocks
- Saving last used model in the chat
- Automatic scroll down while generating
- AI renaming of new chats
- Simple admin panel for adding new models in the app (`/models`)

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Elixir & Erlang (see [install guide](https://elixir-lang.org/install.html))
- Node.js & npm
- PostgreSQL

### Environment & Secrets
1. Copy the example environment file and fill in your API keys and secrets:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env and add your OpenRouter, OpenAI, or Anthropic API keys, and any other required secrets
   ```

2. Fill in the following variables in your `.env` file:
   - `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` ‚Äî **Required.** Your API key for [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/). Sign up and generate a key on their website. This enables all LLM features in the app.
   - `ADMIN_EMAIL` ‚Äî **Required.** The email address for the admin user. On first boot, the app will create (or expects) an admin account with this email. Use a valid email you control.
   - `ADMIN_PASSWORD` ‚Äî **Required.** The password for the admin user. Choose a strong password.

   **Example:**
   ```env
   OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-...yourkey...
   ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@example.com
   ADMIN_PASSWORD=supersecret
   ```

### Local Development
```bash
# 1. Clone the repo
$ git clone https://github.com/yourusername/t3_clone_elixir.git
$ cd t3_clone_elixir

# 2. Setup dependencies & DB
$ mix setup

# 3. Start Phoenix server
$ mix phx.server
# or with IEx
$ iex -S mix phx.server

# App runs at http://localhost:4000
```

### Deploying to Fly.io
```bash
# 1. Install Fly CLI
curl -L https://fly.io/install.sh | sh

# 2. Authenticate
fly auth login

# 3. Launch (creates fly.toml)
fly launch

# 5. Open your deployed app
fly apps open
```

See [Fly.io Phoenix guide](https://fly.io/docs/elixir/getting-started/) for production DB setup.
